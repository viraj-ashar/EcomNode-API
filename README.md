## Order Management System
The order management system provides users with an overview of their orders, past and present. It allows users to track the status of their orders, view order details, and request updates when needed.

## User Authentication and Authorization
The API implements user authentication and authorization mechanisms. Users can register and log in securely, and access to certain endpoints is restricted based on user roles. This ensures that only authorized users can perform sensitive operations.
